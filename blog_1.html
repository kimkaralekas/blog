<p>The first day of my MakerSquare course reminded me of my first Spanish class. I remember trying to wrap my around the subjunctive, how to know which past tense to use (and why there was more than one in the first place...) and honestly just basic syntax in general. 

GitHub, BoilerPlate, git push, repositories...hmmm. I remember "learning" most of these terms when doing the pre-work, but when I began thinking about the application, how everything worked together and/or how to explain the terms to someone if I had to...I realized I had a long way to go.

But just like Spanish, I know I'll get it. Spanish seemed completely crazy and unobtainable when I first began learning, but I *did* end up with a degree in it, which proves that practice, repetition and lots of failing eventually does pay off. It’s just a matter of becoming familiar with the language and doing…even if I have no idea what I’m trying to be doing at this point. 

I’ve done a ton of reading, but as I’m a hands on learner, I know that I just need to keep trying to make stuff and see what happens. Praise the lord for Google as that’s been a lifesaver for when I need to figure something (everything) out every other second. (:</p>
