<h1>MakerSquare: Day 2</h1>


<p>Day 2 was spent using terminal, GitHub and building a website! Commands are becoming more familiar and little by little things are starting to come together...</p>

<p>1/2 the battle at this point is learning the vocab and understanding how everything works together. Our instructors are really awesome and patient as we try to navigate this stuff and let it all soak in.</p>

<p>It's been a pleasant surprise to have 3 or 4 instructors at every class. I assumed we'd have one instructor at a time, but they've always been there which has been really helpful!</p>
